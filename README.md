To-Do List (Plain JS)
This is a simple to-do list web application built using plain JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It allows you to create, edit, and delete tasks, and it saves your progress using localStorage so your to-do list persists even after you close the browser.

Mark tasks as complete: Check the box next to a task to mark it as completed.
Edit tasks: Click on a task to edit its text.
Delete tasks: Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
Persistence: Your to-do list is saved using localStorage so it's available the next time you open the app.

Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/your-username/to-do-list.git
Open the index.html file in your browser.

Technologies Used
